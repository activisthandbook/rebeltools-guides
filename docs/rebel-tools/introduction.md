## Start using Rebel Tools
There are two ways to start using Rebel Tools.

1. **Via our platform:** Just visit [rebel.tools](https://rebel.tools) and get started right away. The platform is still in development, so you will have to sign up for early-access first.
2. **Self-hosted**: Set up a server, customise the app to your needs and host it on your own domain.

## Q&A
**Is Rebel Tools really free to use?**  
Yes, small progressive movements can use Rebel Tools at absolutely no costs. No trial period, no premium features, no ads. Our platform is built by volunteers and our hosting is paid via donations.

**I am not a developer. Can I contribute too?**  
Yes, definitely! We highly encourage you to sign up and join our awesome community. Here are some ways you can contribute: 
- Make Rebel Tools available in your language by translating.
- Create artwork to make our app look beautiful.
- Join our communication team to help promote the app.
- Let us know what features you would like to see.

**Can everyone, really everyone, use this platform?**  
No. We only allow inclusive, emancipatory and progressive movements that agree with [our principles](https://www.activisthandbook.org/en/about/principles) to use our platform.

**Who is behind this project?**  
Rebel Tools is being developed by the Activist Handbook community. We needed this toolset for ourselves, and we thought: why not make it available to everyone?

**How can I start using it?**  
Rebel Tools is still a work in progress. Want to be among the first ones to be using it? Apply for early access: contact@activisthandbook.org
