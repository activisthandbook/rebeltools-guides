## About Activist Handbook
This is a project by the developers team of the Activist Handbook community. 

Activist Handbook is a Wikipedia-like platform for rebels all around the world to exchange their experiences. We needed a platform to host our events and grow our movement, and we decided to develop it ourselves and make it available to everyone for free. 

If you would like to contribute to this project as well, we highly recommend to join our community. We'd love to get to know you!
