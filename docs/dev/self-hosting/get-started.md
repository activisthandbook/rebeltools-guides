Small movements can use [rebel.tools](https://rebel.tools) for free. However, you can also decide to host your it by yourself.

:::warning Technical experience required
We expect you have some technical experience in this guide. As always, we do try to explain everything as simple as possible. However, if you just want to get started with Rebel Tools without having to set up your own server, we recommend you just use [rebel.tools](https://rebel.tools).

## Benefits
Hosting your own Rebel Tools instance is especially useful if you are a large movement with lots of smaller local groups. You can help these smaller groups by hosting your own customised version, which they can then use to organise themselves better.
- Use your own domain name.
- Customise any aspect of the app. For example, you will have more control over the design of  your pages, or you can add features specifically useful for your movement.
- Decide yourself what geographical area to host your Firebase project. This will help your pages load faster.

## Drawbacks
- You need someone with technical knowledge; not just today, but also to maintain it in the future.
- You will need to pay yourself for any costs incurred by running your own Firebase project. Although if you are a small movement, these costs will likely be minimal.
- Hosting your own instance requires more maintainance. You will need to update your instance manually to make use of our latest features.
- Users will not be able to use their existing Rebel Tools account to sign in to your website.
