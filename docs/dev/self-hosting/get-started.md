Everyone can use [rebel.tools](https://rebel.tools) for free. However, you can also decide to host your it by yourself.

:::warning Technical experience required
We expect you have some technical experience in this guide. As always, we do try to explain everything as simply as possible. However, if you just want to get started with Rebel Tools without having to set up your own server, we recommend you just use [rebel.tools](https://rebel.tools).

## Benefits
- You can customise any aspect of the app. This is especially useful if you are a large movement with lots of smaller local groups. You can help these smaller groups by hosting your own customised version which they can use.
- You can decide yourself what geographical area to host your Firebase project. This will help your pages load a bit faster.

## Drawbacks
- You will need to pay yourself for any costs incurred by running your own Firebase project. If you are a small movement, these costs will be minimal.
- Hosting your own instance requires more maintainance. You will need to update your instance manually to make use of our latest features.
