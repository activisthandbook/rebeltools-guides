## Start developing
Follow these instructions to setup the development enviroment on your computer.

### 1. New to web development? üê£
We believe everyone should be able to contribute to Rebel Tools. That is why we have set up a **[free web development course](https://activisthandbook.org/academy/web-dev)** to teach you the basics of HTML, CSS, Javascript, Vue.js, Quasar and Firebase.

The course is offered by [Activist Handbook](https://activisthandbook.org), the Wikipedia for activists.

### 2. Prerequisites
In this guide, we assume you already have the following installed:
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### 3. Fork & clone the repository
